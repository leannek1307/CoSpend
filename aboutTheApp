Please keep in mind that I was not able to distribute the app since I am under 18. 
However, everything is completely functional and is ready to be distributed.

CoSpend is an iOS application I created that can be used among people living with roommates to reduce conflicts.

In the Home tab, there is a text field for the users to enter the address of their shared house, in case they forget them. 
Below that, there are the universal house rules of roommates.

The next tab is Groceries. Roommates can add items they want to the list. 
If the user clicks the “+” button on the top left, a pop-up window appears. 
The user can then enter the item they are willing to add. 
If the user enters text, the size of the Cancel button will decrease and the Done button will appear. 
If the user presses Cancel, the text written will not be added to the Groceries list, but if the user presses the Done button, the text written will be added to the list.

The final tab is Bills. 
This page contains four toggle switches - Rent, Hydro, Water and Internet. 
Next to each switch, there is a label that states, “Paid?”. 
If the user has paid for the item, the user can toggle the switch to on(green). 
If not, the user can toggle the switch to off(white). 
All switches are set to ON in default.
